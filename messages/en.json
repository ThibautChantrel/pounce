  "About": {
    "hero": {
      "title": "What if we added exploration to our workouts?",
      "p1": "Performance, the stopwatch, pushing your limits: these are magnificent drivers of our sports practice. Many of us love analyzing our stats after a good run.",
      "p2": "But sometimes, the urge to run doesn't come from the need to break a record. It comes from the desire to discover, to get some fresh air, to see new neighborhoods. Pounce was born from a simple question: how can we give as much value to exploration as we do to performance? How can we turn our cities and trails into incredible playgrounds?",
      "p3": "We believe physical effort shouldn't just be measured in numbers, but in territories discovered and experiences lived. Sport should no longer be social network, but a social vector of discovery."
    },
    "origin": {
      "title": "The starting point: An idea born on the GR20, with my hiking buddies: Bilal, Fares, Mathias, Hippolyte, Ethan, Anthony et Mathis.",
      "p1": "The idea for this project took root on the trails of the GR20, in Corsica.",
      "p2": "After days of intense hiking to finish this legendary adventure, a thought struck us: beyond the memories and the fatigue, we would have loved to keep a \"certified\" trace of this achievement. A small medal, even a virtual one, symbolizing the conquest of this specific path.",
      "p3": "That is the essence of Pounce (the momentum, the footprint). The desire to create a space that doesn't replace (actualy) your usual tracking apps, but adds to them to mark the routes you've accomplished with a milestone."
